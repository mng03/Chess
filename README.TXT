AUTHORS: Mark Glinberg
NOTES:
This project lacks any sort of documentation or comments because I coded it back when I didn't understand the importance of said documentation (ironically I strugle to understand my own code now...)
I'm not entirely sure what GUI I used, only that it is very outdated and I learned it solely through reading the given textbook, a few online examples, and a lot of tinkering.
This is a fully-functional chess game with a window that notes every move and even includes complex moves such as castling, enpasan, and limits those to the proper board positions. Pawn promotion is also held in a separate pop-up window.
The only thing that is not yet implemented is check/checkmate detection because that was very complex and I didn't have the time to finish it.
